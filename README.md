# hashtable

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects for the Computer Science department at ABCU, I was tasked with creating a comprehensive, user-friendly tool to assist academic advisors in effectively communicating course information to their students. The aim was to read, organize, and provide a structured output of course data, and to enable efficient searching and sorting of this data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by first identifying the core requirements of the system, and then selecting a data structure that would best meet these needs. Given the requirement to search and retrieve course information efficiently, I chose to use a hash table for its average constant-time complexity in search operations. Understanding data structures is crucial as they form the backbone of efficient problem-solving in programming. By correctly employing data structures, I could optimize the operations on the data, enhancing the overall performance of the system.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I faced a few roadblocks during the project, such as handling edge cases and designing the system to scale efficiently with growing data. For these, I extensively referred to the principles of functional programming that were emphasized in the course. I broke down complex problems into simpler, reusable functions that led to cleaner and more efficient code.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has greatly expanded my approach to software design and program development. It made me realize the significance of selecting appropriate data structures based on the requirements of the system, and the impact they have on the efficiency and performance of the software. It also emphasized the importance of adhering to best practices in software development for readability and maintainability.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project truly reinforced the importance of writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The use of a hash table coupled with functional programming principles enabled me to write clean, reusable, and modular code. I leveraged inline comments and consistent naming conventions, which enhanced the readability of my code. Furthermore, the emphasis on functional programming ensured that my code was easily adaptable and could be extended or modified with minimal changes. This has significantly evolved my approach to programming and I intend to apply these learnings to my future projects.
